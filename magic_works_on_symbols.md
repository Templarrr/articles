**Introductory speech to the Arcane University students.**

Magic works on Symbols!

All kind of them. You know - all your garden variety crosses and pentagrams, cups, altars, moon and sun... Symbols don't need to be visual or material - everyone knows the power of some specific place (how many spells you read about should be performed on the crossroad?) and time (full moon, new moon, everyone and their grandma know about the Veil being the thinnest on the night of Samhain) - these are also symbols. Almost anything can be recognised as one.

Recognised.

Re-COGNI-sed.

That's a bit of a circular definition, but the only one that really fully works - symbol is anything you think is a symbol. Your mind is both the main actor and the audience.

Those who only start dabbling in the Craft are often confused by them. Why magic formulas work? Some of them are kinda Latin, but not even real Latin, it's just Latin-ish sounding words with terrible structure. Why just crossing two representations of a line at the right angle suddenly makes vampires think twice before approaching you? Those more scientifically inclined are especially confused - that's not how things work in the real world, that's not how anything works in the real world!

And they are, of course, absolutely correct.

Magic doesn't give a shit about symbols. There's nothing innate to magic that makes lines crossed at the right angle more powerful than 45 or 60 degrees. Full moon doesn't make magic field more powerful than 78% of the full moon.

But wait, you're probably saying to me right now, that's BS. I tried it myself, generations of magic users tried it and it absolutely works. Magic circles hold the summons bound in them, pentagrams chanel and focus the power, and some weird-ass Latin can totally do the thing it shouldn't be able to.

And you are, of course, absolutely correct.

All of these things do make magic more potent, after all, everyone knows that Magic works on Symbols!

...

Ok, hide the pitchforks, folks, I promise it will make sense in a minute, I'm not taking the piss here.

The core thing to understand about the Craft is that in its core it's Mind and Will shaping the surrounding Reality. And while the nature of the Reality doesn't care about the symbols - your Mind does! Oh, how much it does, it's absolutely cracked on symbols. Our brains are the most powerful pattern finding machine in the known Universe, And you really, really can't change your own nature running that deep just by being aware and wanting it. Software can't modify the hardware it runs on. But you can be aware of the fact.

Magic doesn't care about the symbols, MAGES do. You don't need to use them, but they are shortcuts and cheats we created ourselves for our own benefit. Of course, you can use your own will and sheer power of concentration to bound the spirit in place... or you can, you know, just draw a circle with a chalk. What you need to understand is that in the end it will do absolutely the same on the core level! But drawing a circle is infinitely easier, it just pushes the idea of "this place is separated from everything else" to your subconscious magic-making will and frees your mind for actual thing you summon the spirit for.

Why it's important to know? Well, you need to know that you don't need anything, and I mean it, ANYTHING, to do magic. As long as you have your mind and enough of will and determination - you can do any magic, regardless if the book you're read says you can cast it once in a century standing on the pile of sacrifices. In a pinch, when shortcuts aren't an option, you need to know that you aren't stuck, you can just walk the full path the hard way.

And there's another aspect to this.

Some more... radically inclined in our society wouldn't like what I'm about to say, but I need to say it nevertheless, we are the University, and we will say the truth in the face of adversity.

Remember how I said that Mages do care about the symbols? The truth is that everyone, every thinking person, anyone with a Mind and a Will is a mage. Everyone sitting here thinks they are special, and in a way that's true - you have trained and one or another quirk of nature, be it genetics or luck, provided you with stronger access to reality warping powers. But it's not a 0 or 1 thing. Everyone you've ever known or met is doing the small scale magic. And symbols are especially useful for them - they don't have enough power to single-handedly bend the world around them, but they don't need to. Symbols can be shared! There are eight billion people in the world. There's fewer than a million people actively participating in the Craft, those who you usually recognise as mages. Which means there's 8000x more of people out there just providing the background humming of the magic, full of beliefs and power. Tapping into it allow crosses to defend from the vampires even for the common folk. Shared prayer in a church can be more powerful spell than what you will be able to do even after the graduation.

Creating a new idea that catches the mind of the masses is the most powerful way to create new magic paradigm. And using existing paradigm can be the difference between failure and success. You should learn to utilize the flow, yes, you can swim regardless, but swimming with the flow will get you to your point much faster than swimming against.

So yes, Magic works on Symbols!

Even though it really doesn't need to.
