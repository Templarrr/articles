# Short thoughts on AI safety

1. AI is a power-multiplication tool.
2. Any power multiplication tool is inherently dangerous as it is inherently dangerous to handle power.
3. You need your hammer to be dangerous for it to be able to put the nails where you want them to be put.
4. Absolutely safe AI that so many "AI doomers" are pushing for will be absolutely useless toy. It will be a foam hammer.
